<h2>In order to run the game please just run the main.py file inside of the whole folder!</h2>

<h2>The player has to jump between floating islands while avoiding falling off and ensuring that they do not get hit by one of the crocs or the player has to restart back at level 1.</h2>

<h3>
  The game has three levels with a featured level editor with autotile prediction as well as animations for both the player - running, standing, attacking - and for the croc - standing, walking, and getting knocked out.</br>
  The game also features physics as well as automated movements for the crocs to move, with a camera system and a level reset also being built into the game. </br>
  All of the pixel art sprites were also edited by me and included changing the knights sword to a shovel as well as changing the player and crocs designs slightly to fix the necessary hitboxes!
